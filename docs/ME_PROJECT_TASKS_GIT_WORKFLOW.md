## Pull Request Checks

- Bright, dark, and moon themes render correctly
- Chinese and English labels do not break layout
- Module cards still read from `config/modules.ts`
- No hardcoded component colors bypass CSS variables
- No real business logic or connectors were introduced
- `/tasks` navigation remains reachable from the main demo surfaces
- `/layout-engine` navigation remains reachable from the main demo and foundation surfaces

## Module Registry Milestone

- The module registry is the single source of truth for module metadata
- Module Center reads from `config/modules.ts`
- Future modules are registered but not implemented
- No real module business logic is included yet
- Dashboard shows enabled/core modules only
- Module Center can display all modules by category and status
- Future module additions should happen by config first, not by hardcoding pages

## Page Templates Milestone

- Standard module page skeletons are now schema-driven
- Templates include Dashboard / Listing / Detail / Issue / Form / Report / Settings
- Schemas live under `config/page-schemas/`
- Layouts live under `components/layout/`
- `app/templates/page.tsx` is a demo only
- No real business logic is included yet
- No real API is connected
- Future module pages should use schemas first before custom components
- Responsive rules:
  - mobile listing = card list
  - tablet listing = split preview
  - desktop listing = data grid
  - mobile detail = single column
  - tablet/desktop detail = context panel
  - issue pages must support close-loop structure later

## Core Components Milestone

- Reusable components are now centralized under `components/data` and `components/form`
- Page templates should reuse these components before introducing custom UI
- Components are theme-token based
- Components must support bilingual layout and English overflow protection
- Component demo route lives at `/components`
- No real business logic is included yet
- No real API is connected
- Future module pages should compose from these components first

## Task Engine Milestone

- Task Engine route lives at `/tasks`
- Task detail route lives at `/tasks/[taskId]`
- Task mock data lives under `data/tasks/`
- Task pages reuse shared data and form-adjacent UI primitives
- Source-mapping links connect demo module records to Task Engine views
- No real workflow engine, notification service, database, or API is connected

## Layout Engine / Skin System Foundation

- `/layout-engine` route now exists
- `LayoutRegistry` exists under `config/layout-engine/`
- `SkinRegistry` exists under `config/layout-engine/`
- DisplayModel adapters exist under `config/layout-engine/`
- `ModulePageRenderer` foundation exists under `components/layout-engine/`
- This is metadata-first and preview-only for now
- Existing module pages are not fully migrated yet
- No real business logic is included
- No real API/database is connected
- No persisted skin preference is implemented yet
- Future UI redesigns should prefer layout/skin changes before rewriting module pages
- Current foundation status: completed as `v0.5.2-layout-engine-foundation`
- Next recommended milestone: `v0.5.4 Procurement + Supplier + Inventory implementation foundation`

## Procurement Supplier Inventory MVP Planning

- `v0.5.3` is planning-only.
- Covers Procurement + Supplier + Inventory MVP boundaries.
- Includes data model planning.
- Includes mock-to-real migration planning.
- Includes API boundary planning.
- Includes task linkage and layout-engine compatibility rules.
- No implementation is included yet.

## Demo Pages Milestone

- Demo pages are local mock-data only.
- Demo data lives under `data/demo/`.
- `/demo` shows a cross-module demo workspace.
- `/demo/[module]` shows a module-specific demo workspace.
- Demo pages use existing module registry, page templates, and core components.
- No real API is connected.
- No real database is connected.
- No real procurement, inventory, or POS execution logic is included.
- Demo flow is for presentation and validation only.


## Service Layer Foundation (v0.6.0)

- A mock-first service layer and repository contract foundation exists.
- Repository provider defaults to mock mode.
- No real API/database/business implementation is included yet.

## Data Provider Integration / Page Data Boundary

- When updating UI pages, route-level components should read data via `lib/services/*` (or `lib/page-data/*`) instead of importing `data/*`.
- Keep repository provider in mock mode until an API-backed repository is ready.
- Do not add Next.js API routes, fetch/axios, or database code during this milestone.

## Action Source Mapping / Button Contract Foundation (v0.6.2)

- Route: `/action-contracts` (metadata-only contract and registry explorer).
- Registry: `config/actions/`.
- Contract types: `types/action-contract.ts`.
- Helpers: `lib/actions.ts`.
- Reusable UI: `components/actions/` (ActionButton + debug cards).
- No real permission enforcement, audit logging, workflow execution, task creation, API/database integration, or persistence.
- Source mapping keys should remain stable even when layout/skin foundations change.

## Permission Placeholder / Role Access Contract Foundation (v0.6.3)

- Route: `/access-control` is added for metadata preview.
- Access config is centralized in `config/access/`.
- Access UI cards are under `components/access/`.
- Access helper utilities are in `lib/access.ts`.
- No real authentication/authorization middleware is added.
- No real API/database integration is added.
- Action contracts can map to access previews without changing execution behavior.

## Audit Trail Contract Foundation (v0.6.4)

- Route: `/audit-trail`.
- Audit contract types: `types/audit.ts`.
- Audit registries: `config/audit/`.
- Audit helper utilities: `lib/audit.ts`.
- Audit UI components: `components/audit/`.
- Action and access previews can now resolve audit metadata previews without runtime enforcement.
- This milestone is metadata-only and preview-only.
- No real persistence, database, API/backend, session lookup, or middleware is added.
- Audit source mapping keys must remain stable across layout/skin/shell redesigns.

## Workflow Trigger Placeholder / Automation Contract Foundation (v0.6.5)

- Route: `/workflow`.
- Workflow contract types: `types/workflow.ts`.
- Workflow registries: `config/workflow/`.
- Workflow helpers: `lib/workflow.ts`.
- Workflow UI components: `components/workflow/`.
- Action/access/audit previews can resolve workflow metadata previews through stable source keys.
- Workflow source mapping keys must remain stable across layout/skin/shell redesigns.
- Metadata-only preview: no real workflow engine, automation execution, queue/scheduler/background job, notification service, database/API/backend, task/approval creation, session lookup, or middleware.


## ME Notification Contracts Update
- Add `/notifications` metadata preview route.
- Add notification contract registry in `config/notifications/`.
- Add notification preview components in `components/notifications/`.
- Keep notification behavior metadata-only with no real sending/provider/queue/scheduler/database/API/backend/session/middleware.
- Keep source mapping stable across UI shell/layout/skin updates.

## ME Report Widget Contract Foundation (v0.6.7)

- Add `/reports` metadata preview route.

## ME Rule Contracts Update
- `/rules` route now provides ME Formula / Rule Placeholder Contract Foundation preview.
- Rule metadata registry lives in `config/rules/` and helper APIs in `lib/rules.ts`.
- Rule UI components live in `components/rules/` and are metadata-only previews.
- No real rule/formula calculation or evaluation is implemented yet.
- No SQL/database/API/backend/automation/task creation/notification sending/session lookup is added.
